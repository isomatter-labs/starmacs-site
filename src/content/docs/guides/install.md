description: How to Install and Setup Starmacs
---

Starmacs is, at its core, simply an emacs configuration.
As such, there is no packaged install from a package manager,
you simply clone the repository for starmacs to your `.emacs.d` folder,
as you'll see below.

## Prerequisites

Starmacs is only a configuration, and does not itself include an installation of Emacs.
As such you'll want to follow one of the following guides in order to setup Emacs on
your system before attempting to use Starmacs.

- [Emacs for Mac OS X](https://emacsforosx.com) is a set of prebuilt applications for MacOS
- [GNU's Emacs page](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html) contains the best OS-agnostic instructions

## Installation

In order to install starmacs, clone the repository to your local `~/.emacs.d` as follows:

```bash
# clone the base configuration
git clone https://github.com/isomatter-labs/starmacs ~/.emacs.d
```
